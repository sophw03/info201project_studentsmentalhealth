## Story Pitch

The college experience is accompanied by anxiety-producing environments and mental health concerns for many students. They face pressures from academic success, financial worries, and social expectations that contribute to anxiety, depression, and more diagnosis. It causes many students to drop out of school and not finish their degrees, which is not fair to them. It also paints a picture of the unattainability of getting a degree and mistrust in the college system. This is why our proposed research project hopes to explore the complex relationship between mental health and college students. It will be done by analyzing two datasets related to mental health diagnoses. We will use them to examine college students' emotional fitness. We plan to investigate factors such as gender, ethnicity, major-specific pathway, and academic and social environment to see if they contribute to mental health outcomes. We will also use data analytics tools to identify these patterns and trends. This can provide meaningful insights into why addressing emotional concerns on campus is crucial for incoming students. Our research will involve data analysis aspects and visualization tools to present our findings in a more accessible way. By undertaking this project, we hope to contribute to the ongoing conversation about mental health on college campuses. We also hope to provide insights to the public that can inform policy and practice on mental health.


As mentioned previously, we hope to use this project to help contribute to conversations about mental health for college students. Mental health among college students is an extremely critical and often overlooked issue. Not only can mental health have a major impact on a large amount of school-related things such as academics and social life, but the reverse is also true. The pressure to succeed and thrive in a very competitive environment is great and the side effects are brushed away. As college students ourselves, we see and experience firsthand the impact that mental health struggles can have on students, especially at a competitive school such as the University of Washington. Whether the pressure is from academics, constantly working and stressing about the next big project, or the new and complex social life formed at university, the influence on mental health surrounds us and can flip within a second. Mental health doesn't just impact college students, but anyone can be in need of mental health support and resources. But within the world of college, these resources are often scarce and seemingly unavailable to students, whether that be due to stigma, diagnosis, fear, or expensive. We want to provide research that proves how valuable these resources can be, and how they can save and impact lives. Our project centers around this complicated and deep-rooted relationship, hoping to bring about clarity and truth to show just how impactful being in college can be on someone. By studying this relationship, a better understanding of mental health can be gained, so that students, researchers, and others can grow to understand the impact that college, and all its accompanying entities, can be taken more seriously.

The Healthy mind study is a valuable resource to our study because it conducts studies on the relationship between mental health and college experiences. Collecting data from thousands of participants across the various universities in America which is what we plan to examine in our own study.
They look at it from a multitude of scopes like race, field of study, type of degree, etc. We will also look at each and incorporate it into our own project, creating a better picture of health outcomes and experiences of college students.
