## Story Pitch
The college experience is accompanied by anxiety-producing environments and mental health concerns for many students on campus. Consistently facing pressures from academic success, financial worries, and social expectations contribute to fairly high anxiety and depression diagnoses. This causes many students to drop out of school and not finish their degrees. This paints a picture of the unattainability of obtaining a degree and the mistrust in the college system itself. This is why our project aims to explore the complex relationship between mental health and college students, shedding light on the challenges they face and the impact it has on their academic and personal lives. Through analyzing two datasets related to mental health diagnoses, we intend to tell a story emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health concerns and advocating for more resources to be available.

We will examine college students' emotional fitness and factors such as gender, ethnicity, major-specific pathway, and academic and social environment to see if there's a noticeable relationship to mental health outcomes. We will also use data analytics tools to identify these patterns and trends to provide meaningful insights into why addressing emotional concerns on campus is crucial for incoming students. Our research will also provide visualization tools to present our findings in a more accessible way. By undertaking this project, we are delving into the intricate and deep-rooted relationship between mental health and college, aiming to bring clarity and truth to the forefront.

Mental health disparities among college students are an extremely critical and often overlooked issue. Not only can mental health have a major impact on a large amount of school-related aspects such as academics and social life, but also their overall well-being. Unfortunately, the pressure to succeed and thrive in a competitive environment overshadows the importance of people's well-being, whether it's mentally or physically. As college students ourselves, we have experienced firsthand the impact that mental health struggles can have on students, especially at a competitive school such as the University of Washington. Whether the pressure is constant academic overload, stressing about the next big project, or the complexities of navigating and creating a social life at university, the influence of mental health surrounds us and can fluctuate within seconds.

In conclusion, our research aims to serve as a platform to amplify these conversations surrounding mental health and students anywhere and everywhere. Because within the world of college, resources are often scarce or seemingly unavailable to students, whether that be due to stigma, diagnosis, fear, or expense. We want to provide research that proves how valuable these resources can be, and how they can save and impact lives. We centered our project around this complicated and deep-rooted relationship, hoping to bring about clarity and truth to show just how impactful being in college can be on someone. By studying this relationship and raising awareness, a better understanding of mental health can be gained, enabling students, researchers, and others to recognize and address the significant impact that college, and all its accompanying entities, can have on mental well-being.
